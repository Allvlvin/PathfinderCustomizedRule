## Trait ##
### 1. Lessons of Chaldira 修改为半身人种族限定 ###
*Lessons of Chaldira  
Source Inner Sea Gods pg. 220, Faiths of Purity pg. 20  
Requirement(s) Chaldira Zuzaristan  
Your studies of Chaldira Zuzaristan’s exploits have given you a knack for avoiding trouble. Once per day before the result of a saving throw is known, you can reroll that saving throw. You must take the second result even if it is worse.*
### 2. Wayang Spellhunter 禁用 ###
*Source Dragon Empires Primer pg. 14  
Category Region  
Requirement(s) Minata  
You grew up on one of the wayang-populated islands of Minata, and your use of magic while hunting has been a boon to you. Select a spell of 3rd level or below. When you use this spell with a metamagic feat, it uses up a spell slot one level lower than it normally would.*
### 3. Magical Lineage 修改为每日选择一个法术位,当你在该法术位准备一个超魔的法术时(至少提升1环),最终环位-1. 例如可以用一个4环法术位准备一个强效火球术,或者1环法术位准备一个击倒魔法飞弹 ###
*One of your parents was a gifted spellcaster who not only used metamagic often, but also developed many magical items and perhaps even a new spell or two—and you have inherited a fragment of this greatness.  
Benefit: ~~Pick one spell when you choose this trait~~. When you apply metamagic feats to this spell that add at least 1 level to the spell, treat its actual level as 1 lower for determining the spell’s final adjusted level.*  
## Feat ##
### 1. Dazing Spell (Metamagic) 修改为每个法术只有第一次的伤害可以晕眩目标 ###
*You can daze creatures with the power of your spells.  
Benefit: You can modify a spell to daze a creature damaged by the spell. ~~When a creature takes damage from this spell~~, they become dazed for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the daze effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Will save to negate the daze effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become dazed, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell.
Level Increase: +3 (a dazing spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell’s actual level.  
Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.*
